# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks (ANNs) to solve complex tasks. It utilizes algorithms that learn from data through forward and backward passes, adjusting weights and biases to optimize performance.

## **1. Forward Pass and Its Mechanism**

The **forward pass** refers to the process of passing input data through the neural network layers to get the output. During the forward pass:

1. **Input Layer**: Raw data is passed into the network.
2. **Hidden Layers**: The data is processed through hidden layers (with activations applied).
3. **Output Layer**: The processed data reaches the output layer, producing the predicted result.

Mathematically, for a given layer:
  [ output} = sigma(W*x + b) ]
Where:
- \( W \) is the weight matrix,
- \( x \) is the input vector,
- \( b \) is the bias vector,
- \( \sigma \) is the activation function (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid).

The result from the forward pass is then compared to the ground truth during the loss calculation phase.

## **2. Backpropagation**

**Backpropagation** is a supervised learning algorithm used to minimize the loss function by adjusting the weights of the network. It involves the following steps:

1. **Forward Pass**: Calculate the output using the current weights.
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compute the loss (difference between predicted and actual output).
3. **Backward Pass (Gradient Calculation)**:
   - Compute gradients of the loss with respect to each weight using the chain rule of calculus.
   - Gradient tell the magnitude and direction of change required in Weights.
   - Negative Gradient: Left side of the minimum, move in the positive direction (add to the weight).
   - Positive Gradient: Right side of the minimum, move in the negative direction (subtract from the weight) to minimize the loss.
4. **Update Weights**: Adjust weights in the direction that minimizes the loss, typically using an optimizer like **Gradient Descent**.
5. **Repeat**: This process is repeated for each batch of data, improving the weights incrementally.

The gradient is calculated for each layer, starting from the output layer and propagating backwards through the network, hence the name **Backpropagation**.

## **3. Optimizer Comparison**

| **Optimizer**        | **Description**                                                                                     | **Convergence Speed**    | **Pros**                                                         | **Cons**                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gradient Descent (GD)**    | The basic optimization algorithm where the model's weights are updated in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function., entire data | Slow, stable                    | Simple, works well for convex problems.                         | Slow convergence, can get stuck in local minima.              |
| **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** | Update weights based on a randomly selected mini-batch of data, speeding up convergence.       | Faster (due to randomness) | Faster than GD, suitable for large datasets.                     | Noisy, high variance in the updates.                         |
| **SGD + Momentum**    | Adds momentum to the updates, helping the optimizer to maintain direction during updates and reduce oscillation            | Faster                    | Helps escape local minima, smoothens the updates.               | Needs careful tuning of the momentum term.                    |
| **RMSprop**           | Divides the learning rate by a moving average of the squared gradients, making the optimizer adaptive. | Fast                      | Adaptively changes the learning rate for each parameter.        | Requires careful tuning of the hyperparameters.               |
| **Adam**              | Combines ideas from both momentum and RMSprop, keeping an adaptive learning rate.                    | Fast                      | Works well in practice for most tasks, handles noisy data well. | More memory-intensive, may not converge for very noisy data. |
