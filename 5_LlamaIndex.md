# LlamaIndex

*A tool or framework designed to index (Store) and querry large dataset

## Key Features

- **Document Indexing**: Efficiently index large amounts of data for fast retrieval.
- **Data Connectors**: Seamlessly connect to external databases, APIs, and documents.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Use documents as context for generating responses or insights.
- **Flexible Pipelines**: Build complex workflows for integrating LLMs and external tools.
- **Modular**: Integrate with popular tools, models, and services like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and more.

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Index**
An **Index** is the main object in LlamaIndex, allowing you to store and retrieve documents. 
It works by converting documents into a format that can be efficiently searched and retrieved by the system.

#### Types of Indexes:
- **List Index**: Store documents as a simple list, great for small-scale applications.
- **Keyword Table Index**: Organize documents based on keywords for faster retrieval.
- **Vector Index**: Converts documents into vector embeddings for similarity-based retrieval.
- **Tree Index**: Creates hierarchical document structures, useful for large-scale document management.

### 2. **Data Connectors**
LlamaIndex can connect to various data sources to ingest and index data for use with LLMs. Common data connectors include:
- **File Connectors**: Connect to local or cloud-based file systems to index document files (e.g., PDFs, text files).
- **Database Connectors**: Integrate with SQL and NoSQL databases for direct access to structured data.
- **API Connectors**: Fetch data from external APIs to augment the information used by the LLM.

### 3. **Query Engine**
Once data is indexed, LlamaIndex provides a query engine to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. The query engine can work with various types of indexes, including vector-based retrieval for semantic searches.

- **Basic Queries**: Retrieve documents based on exact matches or keyword search.
- **Semantic Queries**: Perform similarity-based queries, using vector embeddings to find contextually relevant documents.

### 4. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
LlamaIndex supports **RAG workflows**, where the LLM retrieves relevant documents or data points from an index and uses them as context to generate more accurate or insightful responses.

- **Document Retrieval**: Query the index for documents based on semantic relevance.
- **LLM Response Generation**: Use retrieved documents as context to generate responses or summaries.

### 5. **Pipelines**
LlamaIndex allows you to define custom workflows, or pipelines, to automate the process of querying, retrieving, and generating content.

- **Chain Pipelines**: Sequentially link multiple processing steps (e.g., query ‚Üí retrieval ‚Üí generation).
- **Parallel Pipelines**: Execute tasks concurrently for efficiency, such as querying multiple indexes in parallel.

## Why LlamaIndex?
- **Efficient Document Indexing**: Handle large datasets with various indexing strategies like **keyword**, **vector**, and **tree-based** indexes for fast retrieval.
- **Seamless Integration with LLMs**: Leverage the power of LLMs for enhanced, contextually aware responses via retrieval-augmented generation.
- **Customizable Querying**: Perform both **semantic** and **keyword-based** searches across indexed documents for more flexible retrieval.
- **Supports RAG Workflows**: Enrich your applications with retrieval-augmented generation capabilities for contextually enriched responses.
- **Open-Source and Actively Maintained**: Continually improved by a growing community of developers and contributors.

## üîç FAISS Indexing Methods Overview

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) provides multiple indexing strategies for fast and efficient vector similarity search. Here's a comparison of the most commonly used indexing methods:

### üìä Indexing Methods Comparison

| Index Type | Description | Accuracy | Speed | Memory Usage | Scalability | Best Use Case | Tunable Parameters |
|------------|-------------|----------|-------|---------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **FLAT** | Brute-force exact search. Compares query with all stored vectors. | ‚úÖ Exact | üü° Medium | üî¥ High | ‚ùå Low | Small datasets, testing | None |
| **IVF** (Inverted File Index) | Vectors are clustered using k-means. Query searches within selected clusters only. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Approximate (depends on `nprobe`) | ‚úÖ Fast | üü¢ Efficient | ‚úÖ Scalable | Medium-large datasets | `nlist`, `nprobe` |
| **HNSW** (Graph-based) | Vectors form a multi-layered proximity graph. Query traverses graph for nearest neighbors. | ‚úÖ High | ‚úÖ Very Fast | üü° Medium-High | ‚úÖ Scalable | Real-time, high-accuracy apps | `M`, `efSearch`, `efConstruction` |
| **PQ** (Product Quantization) | Compresses vectors into low-bit codes for memory efficiency. Searches in compressed space. | üî¥ Lower (due to compression) | ‚úÖ Fast | ‚úÖ Very Low | ‚úÖ Highly scalable | Billion-scale search, low-memory environments | `m`, `nbits` |

---

### üîß Key Parameter Tips

- `nprobe` (IVF): Number of clusters to search ‚Üí higher means better accuracy but slower.
- `M` (HNSW): Number of edges per node ‚Üí more edges = more accuracy, more memory.
- `efSearch` (HNSW): Number of nodes explored during query ‚Üí higher = better recall.
- `m`, `nbits` (PQ): Controls compression rate ‚Üí smaller `nbits` = more compression, less accuracy.

---

### ‚úÖ Choosing the Right Index

| Use Case | Recommended Index |
|----------|-------------------|
| Small dataset with high accuracy needed | `IndexFlatL2` (FLAT) |
| Large dataset with good speed and accuracy balance | `IndexIVFFlat` or `IndexIVFPQ` |
| Real-time app with very fast queries | `IndexHNSWFlat` |
| Memory-limited environments with huge datasets | `IndexPQ` or `IndexIVFPQ` |

---

### üìò Notes

- FLAT search is always exact but becomes very slow for large datasets.
- IVF is scalable but needs tuning (`nlist`, `nprobe`) for better recall.
- HNSW gives high performance and accuracy out-of-the-box, great for production.
- PQ is perfect when storage and memory are limited, but comes at an accuracy cost.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Chunking Methods for LLM Context Preparation

When working with large documents, it‚Äôs essential to split text into smaller, manageable **chunks** that LLMs can understand and process. Below is a comparison of commonly used chunking methods, especially in frameworks like **LlamaIndex**.

---

### üìä Chunking Methods Comparison

| Chunking Method | Basis | Context Retention | Speed | Chunk Size Control | Best For | Overlapping Support |
|------------------|-------|--------------------|-------|---------------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Fixed-size Chunking** | Characters or tokens | ‚ùå Low | ‚úÖ Very Fast | ‚úÖ Yes | Prototyping, small apps | ‚úÖ Optional |
| **Recursive Text Splitting** | Structure (headings, paragraphs, sentences) | ‚úÖ Medium-High | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | Structured documents (blogs, reports) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Sentence Window Chunking** | Sentences in overlapping windows | ‚úÖ High | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | ‚ùå Less precise | QA systems, summarization | ‚úÖ Built-in |
| **Token Overlap Chunking** | Tokens with fixed overlap | ‚úÖ High | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | ‚úÖ Yes | LLM pipelines, dense data | ‚úÖ Built-in |
| **Markdown-aware Chunking** | Markdown structure (headings, lists) | ‚úÖ Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate | Docs, technical content | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Semantic Chunking** | Meaning-based segmentation (via embeddings/LLMs) | ‚úÖ‚úÖ Very High | ‚ùå Slow | ‚ùå No | High-accuracy RAG, semantic search | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental |

---

### üîß Key Concepts

- **Chunk Size:** Usually defined in terms of **tokens** (e.g., 512 tokens per chunk).
- **Chunk Overlap:** Helps maintain context between chunks, avoids loss at chunk boundaries.
- **Structure-aware Splitting:** Maintains natural document flow by splitting at logical points (e.g., after a paragraph or heading).
- **Semantic Splitting:** Uses LLMs or embeddings to split text at meaningful boundaries ‚Äî highest quality but computationally expensive.

---

### ‚úÖ Choosing the Right Chunking Method

| Use Case | Recommended Chunking |
|----------|----------------------|
| Quick experiments / simple apps | `Fixed-size Chunking` |
| Blogs, articles, structured docs | `Recursive Text Splitting` |
| QA or RAG pipelines with LLMs | `Sentence Window` or `Token Overlap` |
| Markdown-heavy content | `Markdown-aware Chunking` |
| Precision-critical semantic tasks | `Semantic Chunking` (if compute allows) |

---

### üß† Tips for Effective Chunking

- Always balance **chunk size** and **overlap** to avoid token limits and loss of context.
- Overlap is especially important in **conversational AI**, **summarization**, or **semantic search**.
- For most use-cases, a **chunk size of 512‚Äì1024 tokens** with **20‚Äì100 token overlap** is a good starting point.
- Use `TextSplitter` classes in libraries like LlamaIndex or LangChain to customize chunking.

---

### üìò Example: RecursiveTextSplitter (LlamaIndex)

```python
from llama_index.text_splitter import SentenceSplitter

splitter = SentenceSplitter(
    chunk_size=512,
    chunk_overlap=64,
    separator=" "
)

chunks = splitter.split_text(long_text)
```

---

Feel free to modify chunking logic based on:
- Your model‚Äôs token limit (e.g., 4096, 8192, 32k)
- Document structure and formatting
- Latency/throughput requirements
