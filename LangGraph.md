# üåê What is LangGraph?
- LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-agent AI workflows.
- It extends LangChain by introducing a graph-based execution model, where you define your workflow as a graph of nodes (agents, tools, functions) connected by edges (control flow).

## ‚ö° Why LangGraph?
- LangChain is great for chains (linear sequences of calls).
- But real-world workflows need branching, loops, memory, conditional execution.
- LangGraph gives this power by modeling workflows as graphs.
